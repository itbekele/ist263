    <h1>Boston is for Book-Lovers</h1>
    

    This past August, I got the chance to stay in Boston for a week with my friend Grace, who had been living in Brookline for the summer. Besides enjoying a game at Fenway, frolicking on Newbury, and eating tons of oysters in Seaport, we also checked out a few of Boston’s best bookstores and libraries. If you’re a book lover, be sure to check out these spots the next time you’re in Beantown:

        <li>Trident Book Stores </li>
        <li> Brookline Book Smith </li>
        <li> Boston Public Library</li>
    </ol>
