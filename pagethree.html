    <h1>Boston is for Book-Lovers</h1>
    

    This past August, I got the chance to stay in Boston for a week with my friend Grace, who had been living in Brookline for the summer. Besides enjoying a game at Fenway, frolicking on Newbury, and eating tons of oysters in Seaport, we also checked out a few of Boston’s best bookstores and libraries. If you’re a book lover, be sure to check out these spots the next time you’re in Beantown: 
 
    <ol> 
        <li>Trident Book Stores </li><br>

        Whether you’re looking for a quick bite on Newbury or searching for Booktok’s latest rec, Trident has you covered. This is a great spot for people who love going to bookstores just for the sake of perusing, as it has multiple floors and more aisles than I could keep track of. Also be sure to check out their adorable selection of tote bags and knick-knacks on your way out.
        <li> Brookline Book Smith </li><br> 
        <img src="images/brookline.png" alt="cafepic" width="275" height="275"><br>
        This spot is cozy, hipster, and just a little-bit kitschy, much like the neighborhood of Brookline itself. If you’re looking a laidback spot to kill some time and sit looking mysterious while pretending to read a Penguin Classic, Brookline Book Smith is perfect for you. 
        <li> Boston Public Library</li><br>

        No trip to Boston is complete with a visit to the BPL. Even if you’re not a reader, the Boston Public Library is worth visiting for its stunning architecture alone. Grab a coffee from their first-floor café and head to the fountain garden in the back to feel like you’ve been transported to a piazza in Italy, instead of chilling in Boston’s bustling downtown.
